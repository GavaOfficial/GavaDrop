# GavaDrop - Update History

## Version 0.8.0 (Current)

### File Transfer & WebRTC Implementation
- **Complete WebRTC-based file transfer system** with peer-to-peer communication
  - Direct device-to-device file sharing without server intermediaries
  - Real-time transfer progress tracking with synchronized progress bars
  - Support for multiple file formats and sizes
  - Chunk-based transfer with 16KB packets for optimal performance
  
### Network Discovery & Room Management
- **Local network device discovery** with subnet-based room creation
  - Automatic IP-based room assignment (e.g., 192.168.1.x devices in same room)
  - Real-time peer list updates when devices join/leave network
  - Random device name generation with customizable names
  - Persistent device name storage using localStorage

### User Interface & Experience
- **Modern React/Next.js frontend** with responsive design
  - Clean, intuitive interface with shadcn/ui components
  - Drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback
  - Device selection with hover effects and selection indicators
  - Dark/light theme support with system preference detection

### Transfer Management System
- **Advanced file request/response workflow**
  - Pop-up notifications for incoming file requests with accept/reject options
  - Sender receives immediate feedback on request status (accepted/rejected/timeout)
  - Graceful error handling with user-friendly error messages
  - Connection cleanup and reusability for multiple file transfers

### Real-time Communication
- **Socket.IO-based signaling server** for WebRTC coordination
  - Handles ICE candidate exchange and session descriptions
  - Manages room-based peer discovery and communication
  - Real-time progress updates synchronized between sender and receiver
  - Automatic reconnection handling for network interruptions

### Progress Tracking & Feedback
- **Comprehensive transfer monitoring**
  - Real-time progress bars visible on both sender and receiver devices
  - Transfer speed calculation and ETA estimation
  - File metadata display (name, size, progress percentage)
  - Visual indicators for different transfer states (pending, active, completed, error)

### Device Management
- **Flexible device naming system**
  - Click-to-edit device names with inline editing interface
  - Persistent name storage across browser sessions
  - Real-time name updates broadcast to all connected devices
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)

### Error Handling & Reliability
- **Robust error management**
  - Connection timeout handling with configurable timeouts
  - File rejection handling with proper cleanup
  - Network interruption recovery
  - Clear error messages for different failure scenarios

### Architecture & Performance
- **Modern tech stack optimization**
  - Next.js 15 with Turbopack for fast development builds
  - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive and maintainable styling
  - Custom hooks for clean component organization

### Security & Privacy
- **Privacy-focused design**
  - No file data passes through central servers
  - Direct peer-to-peer encryption via WebRTC
  - Local network restriction prevents unauthorized external access
  - No file storage or logging on server infrastructure

## Version 0.7.0

### Network Architecture
- **Node.js signaling server** with Express and Socket.IO
- **Room-based connection management** for local network isolation
- **Basic peer discovery** and connection establishment
- **Initial ICE candidate handling**

## Version 0.6.0

### Project Initialization
- **Project structure setup** with Git repository
- **Technology stack selection** (React, Next.js, Node.js, WebRTC)
- **Development environment configuration**
- **Basic build system setup**

### Research & Planning
- **WebRTC technology research** for peer-to-peer communication
- **File transfer protocol design**
- **Network topology planning** for local area network functionality
- **UI/UX wireframing** and design planning
